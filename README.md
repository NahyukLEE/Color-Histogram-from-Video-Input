This sourse is for getting color histogram data from video input. The process is right here.
1. You can get multiple images from video frames, and each images has 50 frames apart.
2. Numpy will calculate multiple images' RGB pixel values, and make 'average.jpg' that has average RGB datas of input images.
3. Getting color histogram from the image.
